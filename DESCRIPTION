Description: An implementation of the advanced gene 
             search in R. This package has basic 
             annotation information. Also, it contains 
             a relative intact gene database which was
             obtained from the Human Gene Database
             <https://www.genecards.org>. It allows 
             users to search gene symbol or alias 
             and convert gene interested to the 
             consistent gene symbols. It also
             provides users with gene WIKI 
             introduction.
